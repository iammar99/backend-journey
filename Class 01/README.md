## Fundamentals of JS



### Foreach Loop 

Used for iterating over whole array or object. It is a block of code that is executed for each element in the array or object.It does not change the original array also not return any new array


### Map Function

It is used to return a new array with the results of applying a provided function on every element in this array. It creating a whole new array having same number of elements of old array


### Filter Function

It is used to return a new array based on a condition . It is used to filter out the elements from the array which do not satisfy the condition. 


### Find Function

It is used to find First occurence of the element in the array which satisfies the condition. It returns the first element in the array that satisfies

### indexOf Function

It is used to find index of first occurenece of element . It returns the index of the first occurrence of the element in the array. If the element is not found it returns -1.  


## Array & objects

Objects Store values in the form ok key value pair . They are mutable(Changeable / Editable) . Whereas we can use freeze method to make them immutable(un-Changeable / un-Editable) .
```
Object.freeze(obj)
```

## Function Return

Functions are block of code which can be executed multiple times . They can take arguments and return values . They can be used to perform complex operations in a simple way . They are created once and canbe called multiple times . Whenever a function is called the **Control** return to the line where function is created and after executing it come back to line where it is called . We can also meaure length of function of function same as array or object . <br>
But Wait !!! <br>
What is function length ? <br>
It is number of parameters in function .<br>


## Async Await

Await key words are used with async functions . It is used to pause the execution of the function until the promise is resolved . It is used to handle asynchronous code in a synchronous way . It wait till awaited lien is executed without disturbing other lines of code
